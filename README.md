# Fraud Detection Project

An explainable fraud detection framework based on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. This project integrates advanced feature engineering techniques with a multi-layer stacking ensemble model to enhance detection performance in imbalanced and dynamic e-commerce environments.

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent online transactions using a combination of data preprocessing, ensemble modeling, and model interpretation techniques. It is built on a real-world dataset and addresses key challenges such as class imbalance and feature complexity.

**Key Features:**

- Preprocessing for high-cardinality, missing values, and data imbalance
- Extensive feature engineering (aggregation, time-related features, categorical encoding)
- Stacking ensemble model with multiple base learners
- Explainability using SHAP
- Evaluation using AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall

## Dataset

The [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection) is used in this project. It includes over 590,000 online transactions with transaction and identity features. 

Due to file size limitations, raw CSV files and model artifacts are **not included** in the GitHub repository.
